# Uber Taxi Fare Prediction – Machine Learning Regression Project

This project focuses on predicting taxi fare prices for Uber rides using a supervised machine learning approach. The goal is to build a regression model capable of estimating fare amounts based on trip characteristics such as pickup/dropoff coordinates, passenger count, and trip distance.

The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and a prediction interface.

## 🚕 1. Project Overview

Uber provides millions of rides every day, generating large amounts of trip data. Accurate fare prediction systems help:

- Improve customer transparency  
- Optimize pricing models  
- Detect unusual ride patterns  
- Reduce fraud and miscalculations  

This project builds a regression pipeline to predict fare amounts using the publicly available Uber Taxi Fare dataset.

## 🧠 3. Dataset Description

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| key | Unique trip identifier |
| fare_amount | Fare price in USD |
| pickup_datetime | Date and time when the ride started |
| pickup_longitude | Pickup location (longitude) |
| pickup_latitude | Pickup location (latitude) |
| dropoff_longitude | Dropoff location (longitude) |
| dropoff_latitude | Dropoff location (latitude) |
| passenger_count | Number of passengers |

## 🔧 4. Feature Engineering

Key feature engineering steps include:

- Extracting **year, month, day, hour, weekday** from pickup datetime  
- Calculating **Haversine distance** (distance between pickup and dropoff)  
- Removing geographical outliers  
- Handling missing values  
- Filtering unrealistic passenger counts  
- Cleaning negative or zero fares  

Engineered features include:

- `pickup_year`  
- `pickup_month`  
- `pickup_day`  
- `pickup_hour`  
- `pickup_weekday`  
- `distance_km`

## 📊 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed analyses include:

- Distribution of fare amounts  
- Passenger count analysis  
- Trip distance distributions  
- Relationship between fare and distance  
- Detecting extreme values and anomalies  
- Visualizing geospatial pickup/dropoff patterns

## 🤖 6. Machine Learning Models

Trained and evaluated the following regression models:

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

Evaluation metrics:

- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
- **R² Score**  

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved superior performance compared to Linear Regression.
