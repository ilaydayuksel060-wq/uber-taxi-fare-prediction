    "# Uber Taxi Fare Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on trip data from **Uber Inc.**, one of the largest ride-hailing companies in the world.  \n",
    "The goal is to build regression models to **predict the fare amount** for future Uber rides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber serves hundreds of thousands of customers every day. Managing this large volume of trip data is crucial for generating new business insights and improving decision making. Accurate fare estimation is an important part of pricing strategies and customer satisfaction.\n",

    "## 📊 Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (referred from Kaggle) contains the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **key** – Unique identifier for each trip  \n",
    "- **fare_amount** – The cost of each trip in USD  \n",
    "- **pickup_datetime** – Date and time when the meter was engaged  \n",
    "- **passenger_count** – Number of passengers in the vehicle (driver-entered value)  \n",
    "- **pickup_longitude** – Longitude where the meter was engaged  \n",
    "- **pickup_latitude** – Latitude where the meter was engaged  \n",
    "- **dropoff_longitude** – Longitude where the meter was disengaged  \n",
    "- **dropoff_latitude** – Latitude where the meter was disengaged  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Acknowledgement:**  \n",

    "## 🎯 Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the dataset and perform data cleaning (if required).  \n",
    "- Engineer meaningful features (e.g., distance, date & time features).  \n",
    "- Build regression models to predict the fare price of Uber rides.  \n",
    "- Evaluate and compare models using metrics such as **R²**, **RMSE**, and **MAE**.\n",
